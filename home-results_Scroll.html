                            <h2>How do I diagnose a bad thermostat?</h2>
                            <p>To diagnose a bad thermostat, you can take the thermostat off the wall and bypass it by connecting R to G to see if the fan comes on, and R to W to see if the heater comes on. If all that works, then you just have a bad thermostat. You can also test it by having the thermostat call and then disconnecting the wires and jumping out the furnace to have the air conditioner come on. If it comes on, it's a bad thermostat.</p>
